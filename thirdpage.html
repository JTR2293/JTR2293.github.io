       Dear Dad,

    <div class="centered18">
      I will always love you for the guidance, comfort, and encouragement I got from you. You are the most awesome dad ever. More than dad, you have been my playmate, hero, coach and mentor. You were the one who always pushed me to become the strong woman I am today. I cannot thank you enough for your constant love and support you showered upon me all these years. It means more than anything to me.
    </div>

    <div class="centered19">
      When I look back at all the beautiful moments I had with you, I know that my life could not have been better. As a dad, you were strong, caring and a man of conviction. I am trying harder to emulate some of your traits so I can set an example of myself too like you did.
    </div>

    <div class="centered20">
        Love you more than anything!
    </div>

    <div class="centered21">
       Your daughter will always look at the time spent with you vastly differently than you do. She will watch every move you make. She might not understand why you are angry sometimes or happy or affectionate, but you will be the most important man in her lifeâ€”forever.
