      Dear Heart,
    </div>
 
    <div class="centered35">
      Being apart from you is more difficult than I ever imagined. I see reminders of you everywhere I look, and they make me ache to be near you again.
    </div>
    
     
    <div class="centered36">
      I love you with all my heart. I cherish every moment we spend together, and I love you even more in the moments when we are apart. Tonight as I write this letter, it's like you are right here with me. I feel your hand on my shoulder, your fingers in my hair, and the soft breath of your kiss on my cheek. I miss you, darling. Come home soon.
    </div>
    <div class="centered37">
     All my love,
    </div>
    
     <div class="centered38">
      Your Forever Girl
    </div>
